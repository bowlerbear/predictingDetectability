Columns and their meaningSpecies: Latin namePopSize_direct_best: The best estimate of species’ population size based on the directly available distance-sampled data for that speciesPopSize_direct_lower95: As above but the lower 95% of the estimatePopSize_direct_upper95: As above but the upper 95% of the estimate
DetProb_direct: The estimate of species’ detection probability based on the directly available distance-sampled data for that speciesDetProb_traits_lm: The estimate of species’ detection probability based on the linear model (lm) using traits
PopSize_traits_lm: The estimate of species’ population size based on the lm using traits to infer detection probabilityPopError_traits_lm: The error of using the trait-based (lm) detection probability when deriving the population size estimateDetProb_traits_brt: The estimate of species’ detection probability based on the boosted regression tree (brt) using traits
PopSize_traits_brt: The estimate of species’ population size based on the brt using traits to infer detection probabilityPopError_traits_brt: The error of using the trait-based (brt) detection probability when deriving the population size estimate
