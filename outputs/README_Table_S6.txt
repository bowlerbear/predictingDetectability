Columns and their meaning

Species: Latin name

PopSize_direct_best: The best estimate of speciesÕ population size based on the directly available distance-sampled data for that species

PopSize_direct_lower95: As above but the lower 95% of the estimate

PopSize_direct_upper95: As above but the upper 95% of the estimate

DetProb_direct: The estimate of speciesÕ detection probability based on the directly available distance-sampled data for that species

DetProb_traits_lm: The estimate of speciesÕ detection probability based on the linear model (lm) using traits

PopSize_traits_lm: The estimate of speciesÕ population size based on the lm using traits to infer detection probability

PopError_traits_lm: The error of using the trait-based (lm) detection probability when deriving the population size estimate

DetProb_traits_brt: The estimate of speciesÕ detection probability based on the boosted regression tree (brt) using traits

PopSize_traits_brt: The estimate of speciesÕ population size based on the brt using traits to infer detection probability

PopError_traits_brt: The error of using the trait-based (brt) detection probability when deriving the population size estimate

Note that the aim of the project was not to produce the most accurate population size estimates so we warrant caution at using these for any conservation decisions.
